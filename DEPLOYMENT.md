# Deploying OpenLDR CE (single HTTPS port)

OpenLDR CE runs behind **one HTTPS port**. An nginx reverse proxy terminates TLS and
path-routes every request from a single origin:

```
                :443 (TLS)                     internal docker network only
  browser ───────────────▶  gateway ┌── /         ──▶ web       (apps/web static site)
            :80 → 301 https         ├── /studio   ──▶ studio    (static nginx: Studio SPA)
                                    ├── /api      ──▶ api       (fastify: REST API)
                                    ├── /health   ──▶ api
                                    └── /auth     ──▶ keycloak  (OIDC issuer, /auth base path)
                                              api also talks to: postgres, minio (blob)
```

**Only the gateway publishes host ports (80/443).** postgres, minio, keycloak, web, studio, and api
are reachable only on the compose network. Auth uses a split front/back channel: the browser hits the
public issuer `https://<host>/auth/realms/openldr`, while the api validates tokens over the internal
JWKS URL (`http://keycloak:8080/auth/...`) so it never depends on the gateway's cert.

## Images

OpenLDR CE ships five independently-versioned images on GHCR (GitHub Container Registry):

| Image | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `ghcr.io/open-laboratory-data-repository/openldr-api` | server/API + `/health` (no SPA) |
| `ghcr.io/open-laboratory-data-repository/openldr-studio` | studio SPA (static nginx, served under `/studio/`) |
| `ghcr.io/open-laboratory-data-repository/openldr-web` | public landing site |
| `ghcr.io/open-laboratory-data-repository/openldr-gateway` | nginx reverse proxy (routes `/`→web, `/studio`→studio, `/api`+`/health`→api, `/auth`→keycloak) |
| `ghcr.io/open-laboratory-data-repository/openldr-keycloak` | Keycloak 26 with the OpenLDR-branded login theme baked in |

Postgres and MinIO use their stock upstream images.

> **Upgrading an existing deployment:** the login theme is selected by the realm's `loginTheme`, which
> Keycloak only applies when it **imports** the realm (`--import-realm` skips an already-imported realm).
> After upgrading to the `openldr-keycloak` image over an existing Keycloak database, enable it once in the
> admin console: Realm settings → Themes → Login theme → `openldr`. Fresh installs pick it up automatically.

### Publishing (maintainers)

```bash
docker login
pnpm run publish:images            # ghcr.io/open-laboratory-data-repository/*, tags :latest + :<package.json version>, amd64
# or: ./scripts/build-and-push.sh --tag rc1 --no-push   # local build without pushing
```

### Two deploy paths

- **From source (`pnpm run init`)** builds the images locally via `docker-compose.prod.yml`.
- **One-line install** (`install/install.sh` | `.ps1`) PULLS the published images — no clone, no build.

### Trusted TLS (Let's Encrypt)

For a public domain, issue a trusted, auto-renewing cert in the install command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Open-Laboratory-Data-Repository/openldr/main/install/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --server-name your.domain.com --letsencrypt you@email.com
```

Prereqs: the domain's DNS A-record points at the host, and ports 80 + 443 are reachable. Add
`--staging` first to test the flow without hitting Let's Encrypt's rate limits. Renewal is automatic
via `/etc/cron.d/openldr-cert` (running `renew-cert.sh` twice daily); if the installer isn't root it
prints the cron line to add manually. Without `--letsencrypt` the installer generates a self-signed
cert (browser warning; not usable on a domain that already served a trusted cert with HSTS).

This is the **one-line-install** path (pulls published images, no clone). For the **from-source**
path (`pnpm run init` + `docker-compose.prod.yml`), see "Production TLS — Let's Encrypt" below —
same idea (certbot over the http-01 webroot, cron-driven renewal), different entry point
(`pnpm run cert` / `deploy/letsencrypt.sh` instead of `renew-cert.sh`). `install.ps1` does not
automate Let's Encrypt on Windows; it prints a warning and falls back to self-signed.

### Trusted TLS (bring your own certificate)

Already have a cert — a `fullchain.pem` + `privkey.pem` from another host, a wildcard, or a
corporate/internal CA? Skip issuance and drop them in. Scaffold without starting, replace the
placeholder cert, then bring the stack up:

```bash
# 1. Scaffold only: writes .env + a placeholder self-signed cert, does NOT start the stack
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Open-Laboratory-Data-Repository/openldr/main/install/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --dir ./openldr --server-name your.domain.com --no-start

# 2. Replace the placeholder with your real cert (keys stay owner-only)
cp /path/to/fullchain.pem ./openldr/config/nginx/certs/fullchain.pem
cp /path/to/privkey.pem   ./openldr/config/nginx/certs/privkey.pem

# 3. Pull the published images and start
cd ./openldr
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

`--dir <path>` scaffolds **directly** into `<path>` (no nested `openldr/`). Pass `--server-name` so the
generated `.env` (`PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, `KC_HOSTNAME`) and the OIDC redirect match your
domain. Windows is identical: `install.ps1 -Dir .\openldr -ServerName your.domain.com -NoStart`, then
copy the two files into `.\openldr\config\nginx\certs\` and `docker compose up -d`.

Already running on the self-signed placeholder? Just overwrite the two files and reload the gateway
(no downtime, no re-pull):

```bash
cp /path/to/fullchain.pem config/nginx/certs/fullchain.pem
cp /path/to/privkey.pem   config/nginx/certs/privkey.pem
docker compose restart gateway
```

Verify the trusted chain is served (no `-k`, and `verify=0`):

```bash
curl -sI https://your.domain.com/health
echo | openssl s_client -connect your.domain.com:443 -servername your.domain.com 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -noout -issuer -subject -enddate
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose v2.
- A domain name (production) or `localhost` (local/demo).
- For a public deployment: DNS A-record → this host, and ports **80 + 443** reachable.

## Fastest path — the init wizard

`pnpm run init` (needs Node + pnpm on the host) interactively configures and launches the stack:

1. Address by **IP** (lists the host's addresses) or **Domain** (e.g. `openldr.online`).
2. TLS mode: **self-signed** (lab/internal), **Let's Encrypt** (public domain), or **bring-your-own**.
3. HTTP/HTTPS ports (defaults 80/443).

It writes `.env.prod` (correct `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` / `SERVER_NAME` / OIDC + Keycloak hostnames), renders
the Keycloak realm, generates/plans certs, brings the stack up, and polls `/health`.

## Manual quick start (local, self-signed TLS)

```sh
# 1. Self-signed cert for localhost (writes deploy/nginx/certs/{fullchain,privkey}.pem)
sh deploy/nginx/gen-selfsigned.sh localhost
# 2. Environment
cp .env.prod.example .env.prod          # then edit secrets (SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY, etc.)
# 3. Build + run
docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f docker-compose.prod.yml -p openldr up -d --build
```

Browse **https://localhost** (accept the self-signed warning). On Windows, generate the cert inside a
container if you have no local openssl:

```powershell
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}/deploy/nginx/certs:/certs" alpine/openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 825 `
  -keyout /certs/privkey.pem -out /certs/fullchain.pem -subj "/CN=localhost" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"
```

## Production TLS — Let's Encrypt (effortless)

DNS for your domain must point at this host and ports 80/443 must be reachable first.

```sh
# 1. Configure for the domain (or set SERVER_NAME + LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL in .env.prod by hand)
pnpm run init            # Domain → your.domain → TLS: Let's Encrypt → email

# 2. Bring the stack up (starts on the self-signed placeholder; :80 serves the ACME challenge)
docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f docker-compose.prod.yml -p openldr up -d --build

# 3. Issue the real cert, install it for nginx, and reload — one command
pnpm run cert            # = sh deploy/letsencrypt.sh  (reads domain+email from .env.prod)
```

`deploy/letsencrypt.sh` runs certbot over the webroot nginx already serves, copies the issued
`fullchain.pem`/`privkey.pem` into `deploy/nginx/certs/`, and reloads nginx. It is **idempotent**
(`--keep-until-expiring`) — wire it into cron for hands-off renewal:

```cron
# twice daily; certbot only re-issues when near expiry, nginx reloads either way
0 3,15 * * *  cd /opt/openldr && pnpm run cert >> /var/log/openldr-cert.log 2>&1
```

Bring-your-own cert instead: drop `fullchain.pem` + `privkey.pem` into `deploy/nginx/certs/` and
`docker compose ... restart gateway`.

## Database migrations & seed

The app **self-migrates on startup** when `MIGRATE_ON_START=true` (set in `.env.prod.example`);
migrations are idempotent. `SEED_ON_START=true` seeds idempotent sample data (the sample dashboard,
org/location/patient, the bundled sample forms, and the default lab-order ingestion workflows) after
migration. Loading real reference terminology (LOINC/RxNorm/SNOMED) and lab data is a separate,
heavier import.

**Seeded vs seedless install:** the installer writes `SEED_ON_START=true` by default, so a fresh
install comes up populated with the sample dashboard + demo data. Pass **`--seedless`**
(`install.sh --seedless`) / **`-Seedless`** (`install.ps1 -Seedless`) for an empty first run — an
operator starting from a clean slate. (Fresh install only; a re-run keeps the existing `.env` value.)

## Supported external databases

OpenLDR CE stores operational data in an internal **PostgreSQL** database (always) and writes
flattened analytics/reporting data to a separate **external/target** database. The external
database may be **PostgreSQL** (default), **self-hosted Microsoft SQL Server**, or **self-hosted
MySQL / MariaDB** — see the support matrices below. Only self-hosted engines are supported; no
cloud/hosted database, for the data-sovereignty reasons set out below.

### Internal database: requires ICU collations

Text sorts (e.g. Audit → Sort by Actor/Action) run with an explicit `COLLATE "en-US-x-icu"`, so
row order does not depend on the server's locale — the bundled `postgres:16-alpine` image ships
ICU support out of the box. A Postgres build **without** ICU (rare — some minimal or
custom-compiled images omit it) rejects that collation and every text sort 500s, with a
server error along the lines of `collation "en-US-x-icu" for encoding "UTF8" does not
exist`. If you see that shape of error on a sort request, the internal Postgres instance
is missing ICU support; switch to an image that includes it (`postgres:16` or
`postgres:16-alpine` both do — this is what ships by default).

### Microsoft SQL Server support matrix

| SQL Server version | Supported | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------|-------|
| 2017               | ✅ Yes    | Minimum supported release (nearest upgrade for 2014 sites). |
| 2019               | ✅ Yes    | |
| 2022               | ✅ Yes    | Pinned for local evaluation + the acceptance matrix. |
| 2016 and earlier   | ❌ No     | End of life / no official Linux container. Upgrade to 2017. |
| Azure SQL, Managed Instance, AWS RDS, any hosted/cloud SQL | ❌ Never | See data-sovereignty policy below. |

The supported set is validated end-to-end on every listed version by the acceptance matrix
(`pnpm mssql:accept:matrix`), and is the single source of truth defined in
`packages/adapter-mssql-store/src/supported-versions.ts`.

### MySQL / MariaDB support matrix

| Engine / version | Supported | Notes |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| MySQL 8.4 LTS    | ✅ Yes    | Pinned for the managed demo container + acceptance matrix. |
| MariaDB 11.4 LTS | ✅ Yes    | Validated by the acceptance matrix. |
| MySQL 8.0 / MariaDB 10.11 | ⚠️ Best-effort | Likely works via the same mysql2 adapter; not validated. |
| MySQL 5.7 and earlier | ❌ No | End of life. Upgrade to 8.4. |
| RDS / Aurora / Azure Database for MySQL / Cloud SQL / PlanetScale | ❌ Never | See the data-sovereignty policy above. |

The write path is validated end-to-end on both engines by `pnpm mysql:accept:matrix`, and the full
**read surface** — the query workbench, custom queries, dashboards (including raw SQL), the report
designer, and all built-in data-driven reports — is MySQL/MariaDB-aware and validated on both engines
by the cross-dialect report parity harness (`pnpm reports:parity:mysql:matrix`, Postgres vs MySQL 8.4
and MariaDB 11.4). The supported set is the single source of truth in
`packages/adapter-mysql-store/src/supported-versions.ts`. As with SQL Server, only self-hosted
MySQL/MariaDB is supported — no cloud/hosted database, for data-sovereignty reasons.

### Data-sovereignty policy: no cloud databases

OpenLDR CE does **not** support any cloud-hosted or managed database service for either the
internal or external database. Ministry of Health and laboratory data must remain within the
operator's own geographic and administrative boundaries, on infrastructure they control.
SQL Server must be a self-hosted instance. This is a deliberate, permanent constraint — not a
roadmap gap.

### Demo vs. production

Select the external database at install time with `--target-db` (default `postgres`):

- **Demo/evaluation:** `install.sh --mssql-demo` (or `install.ps1 -MssqlDemo`) provisions a pinned
  SQL Server 2022 container alongside the stack, generates its SA password, and creates the
  `openldr_target` database automatically. SQL Server Developer/Express editions are **not licensed
  for production**, so this container is for evaluation only and must never back a production
  deployment.
- **Production (BYO):** `install.sh --target-db mssql --mssql-host <host> --mssql-user <user>
  --mssql-password <pw>` (plus optional `--mssql-port` / `--mssql-database` / `--mssql-encrypt` /
  `--mssql-trust-cert`) points OpenLDR at your own self-hosted SQL Server (2017/2019/2022). The
  target database must already exist. Keep the password free of `#`, spaces, and quote characters.
  These map to `TARGET_STORE_ADAPTER=mssql` + the `MSSQL_*` environment variables (see the
  Environment section); you can also set them in `.env` directly.

> **Note:** the internal operational database is always PostgreSQL — only the external/target
> database can be SQL Server. The read surfaces are SQL Server–aware: the query workbench, custom
> queries, dashboards (including raw SQL), the report designer, and the built-in reports all execute
> against a SQL Server target, validated end-to-end on 2017/2019/2022 by `pnpm mssql:accept:matrix`
> and the cross-dialect report parity harness (`pnpm reports:parity`).

## Environment

All configuration is environment-driven — see **`.env.prod.example`** for the full, annotated set.
Service hostnames (`postgres` / `minio` / `keycloak`) resolve on the compose network. For a **local
demo without real login**, set `NODE_ENV=development` + `AUTH_DEV_BYPASS=true` in `.env.prod`
(`AUTH_DEV_BYPASS` is rejected under `NODE_ENV=production`).

## Smoke check

```sh
curl -ik http://localhost/            # → 301 redirect to https
curl -k  https://localhost/health     # → {"status":"up",...} (all checks up)
curl -k  https://localhost/           # → landing HTML
curl -k  https://localhost/studio/    # → Studio SPA (<title>OpenLDR</title>)
curl -k  https://localhost/api/workflows   # → 401 without a token (auth enforced)
```

## Upgrade / teardown

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f docker-compose.prod.yml -p openldr up -d --build   # rebuild + restart
docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f docker-compose.prod.yml -p openldr down            # stop (keeps volumes)
docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f docker-compose.prod.yml -p openldr down -v         # stop + drop data volumes
```

The gateway re-resolves backing containers at runtime (Docker DNS), so recreating `api` or `studio`
on redeploy does **not** require a gateway restart.

## Out of scope (here)

Kubernetes/Helm, CI/CD, autoscaling/HA, the optional SQL Server and DHIS2 services (use the dev
`docker-compose.yml` profiles), and log/metrics shipping.
