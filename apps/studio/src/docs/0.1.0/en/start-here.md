# Start Here

Use this manual when you are working inside the OpenLDR web interface. It explains the pages users can actually see after signing in: dashboards, reports, report designer, custom queries, workflows, forms, terminology, users, audit, activity, settings, connectors, and marketplace. Some pages appear only for certain roles.

## Outcome

After this guide, you can find the right page, follow numbered screenshots, search the manual, and move between related guides without needing installation, command-line, API, or deployment knowledge.

## Before you begin

- Sign in to the web app.
- Use a desktop or tablet-sized browser window when possible; the screenshots use the full web layout.
- Remember that navigation changes by role. If you do not see a page, your account may not have the required role.

## Steps

1. Open **Dashboard** from the main navigation.
2. Use the dashboard page to confirm you can see the shared operational view.
3. Open **Reports** from the navigation.
4. Select a report, review its parameters, and notice where the **Run** action appears.
5. Open **Docs**.
6. Use **Search documentation** for a task such as `create workflow` or `permission denied`.
7. Open a guide and use its metadata strip to check audience, role requirements, estimated time, and difficulty.
8. Select a screenshot to open the lightbox when you need a larger view.
9. Use **Related guides**, **Previous**, and **Next** links to continue the workflow.

## Expected result

You know where the web manual lives, how to search it by task, and how to follow a guide from overview to procedure to troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting

- **A page is missing from the navigation:** ask an administrator to check your roles in **Users and Roles**.
- **A screenshot looks too small:** select it to open the lightbox, then close the lightbox to return to the guide.
- **Search returns too many results:** search for the outcome, role, or error text, such as `lab_admin`, `permission denied`, or `create workflow`.

## Filtering any table

Most list pages — Users, Roles, Forms, Activity, Terminology value sets, Connectors, Sites, and the sync activity log — share one toolbar above the table. It works the same way everywhere:

- **Search** matches as you type, across the columns that page names in its placeholder.
- **Filter** opens a rule builder. Add a rule, pick a column, an operator, and a value, then select **Apply**. Rules combine with AND or OR.
- **Sort** adds one or more sort rules, each ascending or descending.
- **Columns** shows or hides columns, and **Reset to defaults** restores the original set.
- **Reset** appears once a filter or sort is active and clears everything at once.

Applied filters appear as chips beneath the toolbar. Select a chip's **×** to remove that one rule, or **Clear all** to remove them all. Search and filters combine: rows must match the search text *and* every filter rule.

## Advanced web usage

This manual is intentionally web-first. It does not document installation, deployment, command-line tools, direct database administration, API automation, or plugin development. Those topics belong in a future advanced documentation web app because users who cannot install or operate the app will not see those features from inside the app.

For the placeholder, see [Advanced Docs](/docs/advanced-docs).
