# Reports

Reports are data-driven: each one links a printable **Report Designer** template (the layout) to a **Custom Query** (the data). Use them when you need a repeatable result that can be run, reviewed, exported, scheduled, and audited from the web interface.

## Outcome

You can browse the report library by category, select a report, fill in filters derived from its template, run it, switch between **Document** and **Spreadsheet**, review **Run History**, and open **Schedules** when your role allows schedule management.

## Before you begin

- Confirm the report you need has already been published. Reports are **not** created from this page — a Lab Admin or Lab Manager authors and publishes them from [Report Designer](/docs/report-designer).
- Confirm the source data has been ingested and is visible to the web app.
- Know the date window or facility filter you want to use.
- Ask an administrator for report-management permission if you need **Schedules**.

## Steps

1. Open **Reports** from the main navigation.
2. Browse the library, grouped by **Category**. Use the search box to filter by name, or star a report to pin it to the top.
3. Select a report. Reports built from a template carry a **Template** badge.
4. Open the report's **⋯** menu and choose **Parameters**. The filters are generated automatically from the parameters defined on the report's template (for example Date range or Facility). Leave optional filters blank when you want the broadest result.
5. Select **Run** in the Parameters panel. The panel closes and the report runs.
6. Read the **Document** tab for the formatted, printable PDF.
7. Switch to **Spreadsheet** to inspect, sort, filter, and export rows as CSV or XLSX.
8. Review the summary strip above the result, if the report defines one, for at-a-glance totals.
9. Open the report's **⋯ Actions** menu and choose **Run History** to review previous runs, status, duration, and output format.
10. From the same **⋯ Actions** menu, open **Schedules** if your role allows recurring runs.
11. If you manage reports, use the report's **⋯** menu for **Edit template** (jumps to the template in Report Designer), **Unpublish** (removes it from the library without deleting the template), or **Delete** (with confirmation).

## Expected result

The report run completes, the result appears in both the Document and Spreadsheet views, and the run is listed in **Run History**. If schedules are enabled for your role, schedule controls are available from the same report area.

## Troubleshooting

- **Run is disabled:** a required filter is missing. Open **⋯ → Parameters** and fill in every filter marked required — most reports require a date range.
- **"date range not selected", or a message naming a parameter:** the report ran without a value it needs. Open **⋯ → Parameters**, set it, and run again. The message names the parameter at fault.
- **The result is empty:** widen the date range, remove optional filters, or confirm that the relevant data has been ingested.
- **An antibiogram shows an `(unmapped)` column:** those are susceptibility results the report could not attribute to a specific antibiotic — commonly a panel-level summary row, a single result reporting two drugs, or a microscopy finding recorded as S/I/R. They are shown rather than dropped so the count is visible; treat a large number as a data-quality signal worth raising with whoever configures the analyser.
- **Permission denied:** your account can view reports but may not have permission to manage schedules, edit templates, or unpublish/delete.
- **A previous run failed:** open **Run History**, inspect the error, adjust filters, and run again.
- **A report you expect isn't in the library:** it may have been unpublished, or it hasn't been created yet — see [Report Designer](/docs/report-designer) to publish it.

## Advanced web usage

- Use **Spreadsheet** when you need exact row values, sorting, filtering, or a CSV/XLSX export for downstream analysis.
- Use **Run History** to compare repeated runs and confirm whether a result changed after new data arrived.
- Use **Schedules** for recurring operational reports when the same filters should run on a predictable cadence.
- The filters on this page come straight from the template's parameters — to add, remove, or rename a filter, edit the template's parameters in [Report Designer](/docs/report-designer), not this page.
- Pair reports with [Audit](/docs/audit) when investigating who changed report settings or schedules.
