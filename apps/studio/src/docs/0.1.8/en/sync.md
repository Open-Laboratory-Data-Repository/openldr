# Distributed Sync

Distributed sync links many labs to one **central** OpenLDR server over intermittent, low-bandwidth links. Each lab runs a full OpenLDR CE instance, works offline, and reconciles opportunistically whenever a connection is available. Lab-owned operational data (patients, requests, results, specimens, reports) flows **up** to central, which keeps a read-only mirror; central-owned reference configuration (forms, dashboards, reports, allowlisted settings) and terminology flows **down** to every lab, which treats it as read-only. Every record carries the `site_id` of the lab that produced it.

## Outcome

On a **central** server you can enroll a lab — minting its Keycloak client and one-time secret — then list, rotate, or revoke sites. On a **lab** server you can paste those credentials into the **Distributed sync** settings, choose a direction, watch live per-direction status, and trigger a sync on demand.

## How it flows

- **Up (lab → central):** operational FHIR the lab owns — patients, lab requests, lab results, specimens, diagnostic reports. Central stores a mirror it never edits; the lab remains the source of truth.
- **Down (central → lab):** reference configuration central owns — forms, dashboards, report definitions, allowlisted settings — plus terminology (code systems and concept maps). Labs consume these read-only.
- **Site stamping:** central scopes and de-duplicates by the originating `site_id`, so two labs never collide even when they create records with the same local identifiers.

## Before you begin

- You need administrator access (`lab_admin`) on both the central and the lab server.
- **Central** performs enrollment and holds the read-only mirror. **Labs** connect to central and push their own data.
- Enrollment mints Keycloak clients, so the central Keycloak realm must grant the admin service account the `manage-clients` and `view-clients` roles. The realm export shipped with OpenLDR already includes them. A Keycloak container first started **before** distributed sync was added needs its realm re-imported (or those two client roles added by hand) — otherwise minting a client fails.
- Use HTTPS for the central URL in production: the client secret is transmitted once at enrollment and lab tokens travel on every sync.
- The lab reaches central **server-to-server over HTTPS**. If central presents a self-signed certificate — the installer default — the lab must be given central's public certificate to trust. A browser clicking through the warning is **not** enough: the lab's server process validates the certificate independently. Download it from central's Sites page and install it on the lab (see [Trust central's certificate](#on-a-lab-trust-central-s-certificate)).

## On central — enroll a lab

Enrollment creates a confidential Keycloak client (`sync-<siteId>`) with a `site_id` token mapper, generates its secret, and records a registry row. The secret is shown **once** and is never retrievable afterwards — if it is lost, rotate.

### Using the Sites page

![Enroll a site dialog with Site ID, Name, and Central URL](sync-enroll-site.png)

1. Open **Settings → Sites** (admin-only). Sites is a Settings page, not a top-level sidebar item.
2. From the **⋯** menu (top right of the page) choose **Enroll site**, and fill in:

   | Field | Notes |
   | --- | --- |
   | Site ID | Stable identifier for the lab, e.g. `lab-site-01`. Lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens; 1–63 characters, not starting with a hyphen. Reused as the Keycloak client id and the registry key. |
   | Name | Optional human-readable label. |
   | Central URL | The public base URL the lab will reach this central server on, e.g. `https://central.example.org`. Required. |

3. **Enroll**. A one-time dialog reveals the values the lab operator needs: **client id**, **client secret**, **OIDC issuer**, and **central URL**. Copy them somewhere safe (each has a copy button) and hand them to the lab before closing — the secret is not shown again. The same dialog has a **Download central certificate** button, so you can grab central's certificate alongside the credentials in one step.

The site appears in the table with an **active** badge. From its row menu you can **Rotate** (issue a new secret) or **Revoke** (delete the client and mark the row revoked).

### Download central's certificate

If the lab must trust a self-signed central (the installer default), give it central's public certificate. From the Sites page **⋯** menu choose **Download central certificate** — or use the **Download central certificate** button in the enroll dialog — to save `central-certificate.pem`. It is served from `GET /api/settings/sync/central-certificate` (admin-only). This is central's public TLS certificate, not a secret; the lab needs it to complete the HTTPS handshake for sync. Requires `TLS_CERT_PATH` to point at central's certificate — the installer sets this and mounts the certificate automatically.

### Using the CLI

Run these on the central server:

```
openldr sync enroll lab-site-01 --name "Regional Reference Lab" --central-url https://central.example.org
openldr sync list
openldr sync rotate lab-site-01
openldr sync revoke lab-site-01
```

`sync enroll` prints the client id, client secret, site id, central URL, and OIDC issuer once, with a warning that the secret will not be shown again. `--central-url` is required. `sync list` shows enrolled sites and their status but never a secret. `sync rotate` prints a new secret once; `sync revoke` deletes the client and marks the row revoked, and is safe to re-run. Add `--json` to any of them for machine-readable output.

## On a lab — trust central's certificate

Skip this if central uses a certificate the lab already trusts (a real domain with a CA-issued/Let's Encrypt certificate). It is required when central uses a **self-signed** certificate — the installer default, and the usual case for a LAN or bare-IP central.

**Why.** The lab's sync worker opens an HTTPS connection to central to fetch a token and push/pull data. Node.js (the lab server) verifies central's certificate against its trust store and rejects anything it doesn't trust — independently of any browser. So even though your browser can reach central after clicking through the warning, sync will fail until the lab trusts central's certificate.

**Where.** Install the `central-certificate.pem` you downloaded on the lab host and point the lab API at it:

1. Copy `central-certificate.pem` to the lab, e.g. `config/nginx/certs/central/fullchain.pem` next to the lab's compose file.
2. Mount it into the lab's `api` container (read-only) and set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to its in-container path. In the lab's `docker-compose.yml`, under the `api` service:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./config/nginx/certs/central/fullchain.pem:/etc/ssl/central-ca.pem:ro
   ```

   and in the lab's `.env`:

   ```
   NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/etc/ssl/central-ca.pem
   ```

3. Recreate the lab API: `docker compose up -d api`.

**Certificate must match central's address.** TLS also checks that the certificate is issued *for the address the lab connects to*. If central is reached by a bare IP (e.g. `https://10.0.0.5`), central's certificate must carry that IP as an **IP Subject Alternative Name** — a certificate that only lists it as a DNS name is rejected by Node with `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID`. Regenerate central's certificate with an IP SAN if needed:

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 825 \
  -keyout config/nginx/certs/privkey.pem -out config/nginx/certs/fullchain.pem \
  -subj "/CN=10.0.0.5" -addext "subjectAltName=IP:10.0.0.5,DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"
```

then restart central's gateway (`docker compose restart gateway`), re-download the certificate, and repeat the steps above on the lab.

## On a lab — connect to central

The lab operator takes the five values from enrollment — **client id**, **client secret**, **site id**, **central URL**, **OIDC issuer** — and enters them on the **Distributed sync** page's **Settings** tab.

![The Distributed Sync page under Settings, on its Settings tab](sync-settings-card.png)

1. Open **Settings → Distributed sync** (admin-only). It is its own Settings page with two tabs — **Settings** (the configuration form) and **Activity** (live status and the recent-activity log). Stay on **Settings**.
2. Fill in the fields:

   | Field | Notes |
   | --- | --- |
   | Enabled | Master switch. Off keeps the workers dormant. |
   | Mode | **Push** (send operational data up only), **Pull** (receive reference config + terminology down only), or **Bidirectional** (both). |
   | Central URL | The central server's base URL from enrollment, e.g. `https://central.example.org`. |
   | Site ID | This lab's site id, e.g. `lab-site-01`. |
   | OIDC issuer | The realm issuer from enrollment, e.g. `https://central.example.org/auth/realms/openldr`. |
   | Client ID | The minted client, `sync-<siteId>`. |
   | Client secret | The one-time secret from enrollment. Write-only and masked — leave it blank when editing other fields to keep the stored value. |
   | Interval (minutes) | How often to sync, 1–1440. Defaults to 15. |

3. **Save**. When **Enabled** is on, the central URL, site id, OIDC issuer, and client id are all required. Saving takes effect immediately — toggling **Enabled**, switching mode, or changing any field starts, stops, or reconfigures the sync workers live, with **no server restart**.

### Watch activity

Switch to the **Activity** tab. A compact status strip (polled every few seconds) shows:

- An **on/off** badge for the whole engine.
- A **push** and a **pull** entry, each reading `running` or `idle`, the last synced sequence, and the last-synced time — or `not started` when that direction is disabled by the mode.
- **Pending push** — the count of local changes still waiting to push up.
- **Last checked** and **Last success** timestamps.

Below the strip, the **Recent activity** table lists each sync event newest-first — direction, event (`synced`, `failed`, `quarantined`, or `diverged`), record count, detail, and time. Click a row for the full error and metadata. Use **Sync now** to trigger a pass immediately instead of waiting for the interval; it reports whether a pass was triggered (and does nothing if sync is disabled).

### Using the CLI

On the lab server you can drive the same config and status from the command line:

```
openldr settings sync show
openldr settings sync set mode bidirectional
openldr sync status
openldr sync now
```

`settings sync set <field> <value>` writes any one field: `enabled`, `mode`, `centralUrl`, `siteId`, `oidcIssuer`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, or `intervalMinutes`. `sync status` prints the live workers, cursors, and pending backlog; `sync now` triggers a pass and fails if sync is disabled.

## Expected result

Central shows the lab as **active** on the Sites page. On the lab, the **Activity** tab shows the enabled engine with a push and/or pull line advancing, and **Pending push** trending toward zero as backlog clears. Central's mirror gains the lab's records (stamped with its site id); the lab receives central's forms, dashboards, reports, and terminology.

## Troubleshooting

- **Sync stays off / nothing happens:** confirm **Enabled** is on and the mode matches what you expect. Re-check the central URL, site id, OIDC issuer, and client id; if the secret was ever blanked, re-enter it (a blank field keeps the previous value, so a genuinely wrong secret needs a fresh paste).
- **`503` "identity provider admin client is not configured" when enrolling (central):** the API has no Keycloak admin service-account credentials. Set `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID` and `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET` in central's `.env` and recreate the API. (The audit log stays empty because enrollment records its audit entry only after the mint succeeds.)
- **`403` when enrolling (central):** the admin service account lacks `manage-clients`/`view-clients`. Re-import the central realm (or add those two client roles by hand), then retry.
- **Enroll fails with `fetch failed: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:443` (central):** the API is trying to reach Keycloak at the public URL, which from inside the container is the API itself. Set `OIDC_INTERNAL_ISSUER_URL` to the in-cluster realm base (e.g. `http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/openldr`) so server-side token/admin calls use the internal address, and recreate the API.
- **Lab sync fails with `self-signed certificate`:** the lab doesn't trust central's certificate. Download it from central's Sites page and install it on the lab — see [Trust central's certificate](#on-a-lab-trust-central-s-certificate).
- **Lab sync fails with `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID` (IP not in cert):** the certificate is trusted but doesn't list the address the lab connects to. Regenerate central's certificate with an **IP Subject Alternative Name** for that IP, re-download it, and reinstall it on the lab (same section).
- **Lost client secret:** it is unrecoverable by design. **Rotate** the site (Sites page row menu, or `openldr sync rotate <siteId>`) to issue a new one, and paste it into the lab's **Distributed sync** Settings tab.
- **Lab tokens rejected at central:** the site was revoked, or the client id / OIDC issuer on the lab does not match what central minted. Confirm the site is active in `openldr sync list` and that the issuer URL points at the central realm.
- **A revoked lab needs to return:** re-enroll the same site id on central; it reactivates the registry row and issues a new secret.
