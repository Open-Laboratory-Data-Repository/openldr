# OpenLDR CE HTTP API

Source of truth: `apps/server/src/*.ts` (route registration in `apps/server/src/app.ts`). Routes marked "admin" use `requireRole('lab_admin')`; workflow manage routes use `lab_admin` or `lab_manager`.

> **DHIS2 is no longer a core API.** DHIS2 shipped as a removable plugin. There is no `dhis2-routes.ts` and the server registers no `/api/dhis2/*` routes. You install a DHIS2 integration from the Marketplace. It appears through the connector model and the plugin UI (`GET /api/plugins/ui`). See [Ingesting & pushing data](OPERATOR-GUIDE.md) for how external systems exchange data with CE.

## Distributed Sync

Admin routes under `/api/settings/sync/*` are user-authed and `lab_admin`-gated. The client secret is write-only on config and returned only once (never in a `GET`) on enroll/rotate.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/settings/sync` | Read the sync configuration (no secret value, only whether one is set). |
| `PUT` | `/api/settings/sync` | Update the sync configuration; `clientSecret` is write-only (blank keeps the stored value). |
| `GET` | `/api/settings/sync/status` | Live sync status: per-direction workers, cursors, and pending backlog. |
| `POST` | `/api/settings/sync/now` | Trigger a sync pass immediately. Returns `409` when sync is disabled. |
| `GET` | `/api/settings/sync/quarantine` | List bulk records the pull stream is holding or has quarantined, with attempt counts and the last error. |
| `POST` | `/api/settings/sync/quarantine/retry` | Clear a quarantined bulk entity and re-sync it by id. Body: `{ entityType, entityId }`. `400` missing/blank input, `409` when sync pull is not enabled. |
| `GET` | `/api/settings/sync/divergences` | List same-version divergences detected between lab and central. |
| `GET` | `/api/settings/sync/divergences/:resourceType/:resourceId/:version` | Inspect one divergence. |
| `POST` | `/api/settings/sync/divergences/:resourceType/:resourceId/:version/clear` | Acknowledge/clear a divergence. |
| `POST` | `/api/settings/sync/enroll` | Enroll a lab (central): mint its Keycloak client + registry row; returns the client id and secret once. |

| `POST` | `/api/settings/sync/sites/:siteId/revoke` | Revoke a site: delete its client and mark the registry row revoked. |
| `POST` | `/api/settings/sync/amend` | Amend a lab-owned result (central operator): writes a new FHIR version and queues it for the owning lab to pull back. Body: `{ resourceType, id, status, reason?, patch?, agent?, activity? }` (`activity` defaults to `amend`). Amends `Observation`, `DiagnosticReport`, or `ServiceRequest` (any other resource type → `400`). |
| `POST` | `/api/settings/sync/merge-patient` | Intra-lab patient merge (`lab_admin`): re-points the duplicate patient's lab history to the survivor and marks the duplicate replaced. Body: `{ survivorId, duplicateId, reason? }`. `400` same-patient/bad-input, `404` patient not found, `409` cross-site. |

The machine endpoints below are authenticated by lab **client credentials** (not user sessions) and scope by the token's `site_id`:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/sync/push` | A lab pushes operational change-log records up to central. **Not** a general external-ingest endpoint. |
| `POST` | `/api/sync/pull` | A lab pulls the reference-data delta down. |
| `POST` | `/api/sync/pull-amendments` | The owning lab drains the central-authored amendment stream for its own resources. |
| `POST` | `/api/sync/terminology/concepts` | Bulk terminology concept delta (central → lab). |
| `POST` | `/api/sync/terminology/map-elements` | Bulk concept-map element delta (central → lab). |

### Compression

Compression is global, so it applies to every route above, but it matters most for sync, which moves the largest payloads over the thinnest links.

- **Responses**: compressed when the client sends `Accept-Encoding: gzip` and the body exceeds 1024 bytes. Already-compressed content types (PDF, xlsx) are skipped.
- **Requests**: a gzipped body (`Content-Encoding: gzip`) is accepted on every route. Any other request encoding → `415` with code `SY0415`.
- **Advert**: every response carries `Accept-Encoding: gzip` (RFC 7694) so a client can discover that the server accepts compressed request bodies before it sends one. The sync push client reads this off the response and only then starts gzipping, which is what lets a newer lab talk to an older central.

## There is no `POST /fhir` or `POST /api/ingest`

External systems do **not** post FHIR to a generic endpoint. The inbound data paths are:

1. **Workflow webhook.** `POST /api/workflows/hooks/<path>`, secured by a per-webhook secret, routed into a workflow you build.
2. **CLI ingest.** `openldr ingest <file> --plugin <converter>` for file and plugin-based loads.
3. **Sync push.** `POST /api/sync/push`, but only for enrolled lab-to-central change-log replication (client-credentialed), not third-party ingest.

See [Ingesting & pushing data](OPERATOR-GUIDE.md) for the full walkthrough.
